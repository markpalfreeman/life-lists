# Life Lists

There are too many things I want to learn and keep track of that I never do. A simple folder structure of lists makes sense, and publicly displaying them adds (some) accountability and openness. So like any good developer, I'm combining everything on GitHub.

**A few guidelines:**
- [README.md](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists): *this week's* to-do list for small, digestible things to do
- [LEARN.md](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/LEARN.md): the main list for learning and goals
- [/content](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/content): resource repository to save stuff
- [/places-and-things](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/places-and-things): non-learning lists (books, travel destinations, etc)
- Pull requests & contributions are always encouraged – be creative!

Without further adieu...
