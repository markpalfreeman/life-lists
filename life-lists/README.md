# Life Lists

At some point my life, task lists, and bookmarks became too disparate, but there are so many things I want to learn and keep track of that I never do. A simple folder structure of lists makes sense, and publicly displaying them adds (some) accountability and openness, so to help me keep track of things, I'm combining everything on GitHub like any good developer. 

A few guidelines:
- [README.md](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists): *this week's* to-do list for small, digestible things to do
- [LEARN.md](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/LEARN.md): the main list for learning and goals
- [/content](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/content): "done" items that I want to save
- [/places-and-things](https://github.com/markpalfreeman/life-lists/blob/master/places-and-things): non-learning lists (books, travel destinations, etc)
- Pull requests / issue contributions are always encouraged – be creative!

Without further adieu...
